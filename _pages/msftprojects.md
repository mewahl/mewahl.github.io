* Land cover mapping with <a href="https://www.esri.com">Esri</a> and the <a href="http://chesapeakeconservancy.org/">Chesapeake Conservancy</a>
    - Released a tutorial demonstrating how our semantic segmentation model was developed on a single GPU VM and scaled up to a GPU cluster on the Azure cloud ([blog post](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2018/03/12/pixel-level-land-cover-classification-using-the-geo-ai-data-science-virtual-machine-and-batch-ai/), [repository](https://github.com/Azure/pixel_level_land_classification))
    - Presented our work at the CVPR DeepGlobe workshop (2018), the Esri Dev Summit (2018), the Visipedia Workshop (2018), the AI for Earth Summit (2018), Microsoft Ignite (2017), and Microsoft-internal conferences and events
    - Enabled distributed training and real-time inference using two early-stage Azure services (Azure Machine Learning Services and Azure Batch AI), providing feedback during product development
    - Assisted with nationwide land cover mapping and design of a feedback collection system
* Object and structure detection from overhead imagery for the xView Challenge
