Studied the gene regulatory network underlying larval mesoderm specification in the sea urchin, with particular focus on the <i>tbrain</i> gene and its regulators/targets. Worked closely with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gee/gee-staff/academic-staff/paola-oliveri" target="_new">Paola Oliveri</a> (now at UCL).
