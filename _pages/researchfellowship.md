[Harvard College Fellowships](http://facultyresources.fas.harvard.edu/college-fellows-program) are 1-2 year faculty appointments for scholars who've recently earned their doctorates. The fellowship facilitates independent scholarship and includes a lectureship component. For more information on my lecturing experience, please see the [Teaching](/teaching/harvardcollegefellowship/) section of this website.

Investigating the utility of crowdsourced genomic and genealogical data for risk prediction, forensics,
and anthropological studies. Helped create an AWS-based pipeline for crowdsourced genomic and genealogical data donation to science on the [DNA.land](https://dna.land/) website.
