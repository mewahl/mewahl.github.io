<p>Iâ€™ve tutored biology, math, chemisty, and computer science, both as a volunteer and as an employee at <a href="https://signeteducation.com/" target="_blank">Signet Education</a> (formerly Veritas).</p>

<p>In fall 2016, I participated in <a href="https://www.tealsk12.org" target="_blank">Technology Education And Literacy in Schools (TEALS)</a>, a program that integrates tech professionals into high school computer science curricula. I also served as a teaching assistant for the first pilot run of the <a href="https://academy.microsoft.com/en-US/professional-degree/data-science/">Microsoft Professional Degree in Data Science</a> on edX.</p>
